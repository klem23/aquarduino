# aquarduino
Arduino controller code for reef aquarium

Features: 
 - blue and white LED control through PWM signal
 - FAN for LED dissipator
 - funiture support FAN
 - level captor and 12V Pump for osmolation


TODO : add schematics


LED Light ctrl : high speed (PWM) transistor switch circuit
Pump and fan ctrl : 12V Emitter transistor switch circuit with flyback diode
level sensor : basic switch with internal pull-off resistor
LED : basic serial circuit with pull-of resistor for running check.
